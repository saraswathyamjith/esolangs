6. Given a string s, return the reversed string.
7. Print "Hello, Pyth!
8. Given two numbers a and b, return their product.
9. Given a number n, return True if it is positive, else False.
10. Given two strings s1 and s2, return their concatenation.
11. Given a number n, return its square.
12. Given a string s, return the number of characters in the string.
13. Given two numbers a and b, return the smaller number.
14. Given a string s, return True if all characters in the string are vowels, else False.
15. Given two numbers a and b, return the absolute difference between them.
16. Given a string s and a number n, return the string repeated n times.
